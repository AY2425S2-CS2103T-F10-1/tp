## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main layers of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/MainApp.java)) is responsible for the app launch and shutdown.

- At app launch, it initializes the other layers in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other layers and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The main architecture can be separated into the following 5 layers:

- [**`View (FXML + Controller)`**](#view-component): The UI presentation of the app.
- [**`Viewmodel`**](#viewmodel-component): Manages the presentation logic and state of the UI.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple layers.

**How the architecture layers interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the layers interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each layer.

### View layer (FXML + Controller)

This layer represents the View layer of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It is responsible for:

- Rendering the user interface and handling user input
- Displaying data from the ViewModel
- Converting user actions into commands that are sent to the ViewModel
- Updating the UI in response to data changes in the ViewModel
- depends on some classes in the `Model` layer, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

This separation of concerns allows the View to focus purely on presentation while delegating data handling to the ViewModel.

![Structure of the View Layer](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The View layer is initialized through the [`Ui`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/controller/Ui.java) interface, which serves as the entry point for UI initialization.

The UI consists of a `MainWindowController` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBoxController`, `PersonTreeViewController`, `MeetingTreeViewController`, `TimetableController` etc. All these, including the `MainWindowController`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `Controller` classes are built using the JavaFX UI framework, where each UI component's layout is defined in corresponding `.fxml` files located in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. These controllers manage user interactions and communicate with the ViewModel layer. For instance, the [`MainWindowController`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/controller/MainWindowController.java) has its layout defined in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

We make use of AtlantaFX Styles to style in-line in controller files as much as possible. FXML files are used to embed controller logic and are intended to be thin UI wireframes, as opposed to fully fledged interfaces.

### ViewModel Layer

The ViewModel layer serves as the intermediary between the View and Model layers in the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It is responsible for:

- Managing the presentation logic and state of the UI
- Converting data from the Model into a format suitable for display
- Handling user input and converting it into commands for the Logic layer
- Maintaining the state of UI components
- Providing data bindings for the View layer

![Structure of the ViewModel Layer](images/ViewModelClassDiagram.png)

The ViewModel layer consists of several specialized view models:

- **`MainViewModel`**: The central view model that coordinates all other view models and manages the overall application state.
- **`CommandBoxViewModel`**: Handles the command input functionality, managing the command text and execution.
- **`ResultDisplayViewModel`**: Manages the display of command results and feedback messages.
- **`PersonListViewModel`**: Handles the presentation logic for the person list, including filtering and sorting.
- **`MeetingListViewModel`**: Manages the display and state of meetings, including scheduling and conflicts.
- **`CurrentWeekViewModel`**: Handles the display of the current week's schedule and time-related information.

Each view model:

- Depends on the Model component for data
- Provides observable properties that the View can bind to
- Handles the conversion of Model data into displayable formats
- Manages the state of its corresponding UI component
- Communicates with the Logic layer for command execution

The ViewModel layer follows these design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each view model is responsible for a specific aspect of the UI
2. **Data Binding**: Uses JavaFX's property system for automatic UI updates
3. **Dependency Management**: Maintains clear dependencies on Model and Logic layers
4. **State Management**: Handles UI state independently of the View layer

### Logic layer

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` layer:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The Logic layer is responsible for:

- Processing user commands and executing them
- Managing the command parsing and execution flow
- Coordinating between the ViewModel and Model layers
- Handling command validation and error checking
- Providing feedback on command execution results

The Logic layer consists of several key components:

- **`LogicManager`**: The main implementation of the `Logic` interface that orchestrates command execution
- **`Messages`**: Contains common message strings used throughout the application
- **Command Parsers**: Located in the `parser` package, responsible for parsing user input into executable commands
- **Commands**: Located in the `commands` package, implementing the actual command logic

How the `Logic` layer works:

1. When a command is received from the ViewModel layer, the `LogicManager` processes it through the following steps:

   - The command string is passed to the appropriate parser in the `parser` package
   - The parser validates the command format and parameters
   - A corresponding `Command` object is created
   - The command is executed, interacting with the Model layer as needed
   - A `CommandResult` is returned to the ViewModel layer

2. The command execution flow:

   - Commands can modify the Model's state (e.g., adding/removing persons, meetings)
   - Commands can query the Model for information
   - Commands can trigger UI updates through the ViewModel
   - All command results include feedback messages for the user

3. Error handling:
   - Invalid commands are caught and reported with helpful error messages
   - Command-specific validation ensures data integrity
   - Exceptions are properly handled and converted to user-friendly messages

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` layer, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Layer for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model layer

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The Model layer is responsible for:

- Managing the application's data and business logic
- Maintaining data integrity and consistency
- Providing data access and manipulation methods
- Supporting data observation through observable properties
- Managing user preferences and settings

The Model layer consists of several key components:

- **`ModelManager`**: The main implementation of the `Model` interface that manages all data operations
- **`AddressBook`**: The central data structure that holds all application data
- **`UniqueItemList`**: A generic list implementation that ensures uniqueness of items
- **`UserPrefs`**: Manages user preferences and settings

The Model layer is organized into several packages:

- **`person`**: Contains classes related to person management
- **`meeting`**: Contains classes related to meeting management
- **`module`**: Contains classes related to module management
- **`tag`**: Contains classes related to tag management
- **`util`**: Contains utility classes used across the model

Key features of the Model layer:

1. **Data Management**:

   - Stores and manages all application data (persons, meetings, modules, etc.) in storage layer
   - Ensures data consistency and integrity
   - Provides methods for data manipulation and retrieval
   - Maintains relationships between different data entities

2. **Observable Properties**:

   - Exposes data through observable lists for UI binding
   - Notifies observers of data changes
   - Supports filtered views of data
   - Enables real-time UI updates

3. **Data Access**:

   - Provides read-only interfaces for data access
   - Implements data validation and constraints
   - Supports data filtering and searching
   - Manages data relationships and dependencies

4. **User Preferences**:
   - Stores user-specific settings in storage layer
   - Provides read-only access to preferences
   - Supports preference modification
   - Persists preferences across sessions

The Model layer follows these design principles:

1. **Encapsulation**: Data access is controlled through well-defined interfaces
2. **Immutability**: Data objects are immutable to ensure consistency
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level components depend on abstractions
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a specific, well-defined purpose

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Model layer is designed to be only dependent on storage layer, allowing it to be tested and modified without affecting the rest of the application.
</div>

### Storage layer

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The Storage layer is responsible for:

- Persisting application data to and from the file system
- Managing data serialization and deserialization
- Handling data format conversion
- Providing data backup and recovery capabilities
- Managing user preferences storage

The Storage layer consists of several key components:

- **`StorageManager`**: The main implementation of the `Storage` interface that coordinates all storage operations
- **`JsonAddressBookStorage`**: Handles the storage of address book data in JSON format
- **`JsonUserPrefsStorage`**: Manages the storage of user preferences in JSON format
- **`JsonSerializableAddressBook`**: Represents the serializable version of the address book
- **`JsonAdaptedPerson`**: Handles the conversion between Person objects and JSON
- **`JsonAdaptedMeeting`**: Handles the conversion between Meeting objects and JSON
- **`JsonAdaptedModule`**: Handles the conversion between Module objects and JSON
- **`JsonAdaptedTag`**: Handles the conversion between Tag objects and JSON

Key features of the Storage layer:

1. **Data Persistence**:

   - Saves application data to JSON files
   - Loads data from JSON files
   - Maintains data integrity during save/load operations
   - Handles file I/O operations safely

2. **Data Conversion**:

   - Converts between Java objects and JSON format
   - Handles complex object relationships
   - Maintains data consistency during conversion
   - Validates data during deserialization

3. **User Preferences**:

   - Stores user preferences in a separate file
   - Loads preferences on application startup
   - Updates preferences when modified
   - Maintains preference consistency

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles file system errors gracefully
   - Provides meaningful error messages
   - Maintains data integrity during errors
   - Supports data recovery when possible

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Storage layer is designed to be independent of the Model layer's implementation details, allowing for changes in the data model without affecting storage operations.
</div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are organized in the `syncsquad.teamsync.commons` package, which is divided into several subpackages:

1. **`core`**:

   - Contains fundamental classes that define the core behavior of the application
   - Provides base classes and interfaces used across different layers
   - Defines common data structures and utilities

2. **`exceptions`**:

   - Contains custom exception classes used throughout the application
   - Provides specialized exception handling for different scenarios
   - Includes error messages and recovery suggestions

3. **`util`**:
   - Contains utility classes and helper methods
   - Provides common functionality used across different components
   - Includes string manipulation, date handling, and other utility functions

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Common classes are designed to be independent of specific components, allowing them to be used across the entire application without creating unnecessary dependencies.
</div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

There are 4 main command groups:

- Teammate (`person`)
- Module (`module`)
- Meeting (`meeting`)
- General

<!--div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Some note here.

</div-->

### Teammate

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

A Teammate is represented by a `Person` object, and is composed of several attributes. All `Person` objects are stored in a  `UniquePersonList`, which interacts with the `AddressBook` class in the [Model layer](#model-layer).

The attributes of the `Person` class represent:
- `Name`: The name of the teammate.
- `Phone`: The phone number of the teammate.
- `Email`: The email address of the teammate.
- `Address`: The address of the teammate.
- `Module`: The set of modules taken by the teammate.
- `Tag`: The set of tags that are related to the teammate.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Each `Person` object is uniquely identified by its `Email` attribute. This means that adding two teammates with the same email is not allowed. This is to allow teammates with the same names to be added.
</div>

#### Adding a Teammate

The command `person add` creates a new `Person` object, which contains the necessary fields that are associated with a teammate.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/PersonAddActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram of the command is represented below:

<img src="images/AddPersonCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The sequence diagram does not show the instantiation of classes that represents the attributes of the `Person` object, as their behaviour is trivial and will clutter the diagram.
</div>

The method call `AddPersonCommandParser.parse()` was simplified and the validation checks for the attributes were ommited, as it would clutter the diagram. The full behaviour of the parser is described below:

<img src="images/AddPersonCommandSequenceDiagram2.png" width="750"/>


##### Notes

- Each teammate is uniquely identified by their email. This means that two `Person` objects that have the same email are considered to be the same teammate. This does not apply to the `equals` property, which checks for equality on all fields.
- The `Name` attribute must only consist of Latin alphanumerical characters, spaces, and allowed special characters (apostrophe and dash) only.
- The `Email` attribute must follow the following constraints:

  - 1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+\_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.

  - 2.  This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods. The domain name must:
    - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
    - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
    - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

- The `Phone` attribute must consist of numbers only, and be at least 3 digits long.
- All attributes must not be empty (including whitespaces).
- If any of these constraints are to fail, the parser will throw an error based on the earliest field that fails in the above order.

##### Future Considerations

- The name constraint can be relaxed to include non-Latin alphabets, such as Chinese characters. This is not an urgent requirement, and given the NUS locality, it is likely that enforcing Latin alphabets is sufficient.

#### Editing a Teammate

The command `person edit` edits an existing `Person` object by its index.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/PersonEditActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

##### Notes

- The same restrictions mentioned in [Adding a Person](#adding-a-person) appplies here as well.

#### Deleting a Teammate

The command `person delete` deletes an existing `Person` object by its index.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/PersonDeleteActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

#### Searching for a Teammate

The command `person find` finds an existing `Person` object by a given predicate.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/PersonFindActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

##### Notes

- The search predicate cannot be blank.

#### Listing All Teammates

The command `person list` displays all `Person` objects, sorted by name.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/PersonListActivityDiagram.png" width="350"/>

#### Exporting A Teammate

The command `person export` exports a `Person` object as text.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/PersonExportActivityDiagram.png" width="350"/>

### Module

<img src="images/ModuleClassDiagram.png" width="250"/>

A Module is composed of several attributes:
- `ModuleCode`: The module code of the module.
- `Day`: The day of the module, stored as one of `"MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI", "SAT", "SUN"`. 
- `startTime`: The start time of the module, stored as a  `LocalTime` object.
- `endTime`: The end time of the module, stored as a  `LocalTime` object.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Each `Module` object is uniquely identified by its `ModuleCode` attribute. This means that adding two modules with the module code is not allowed. It is also not possible to add a module with invalid times (i.e. start time later than end time), or to add a module when there is already an existing module within that time period.
</div>


#### Adding a Module for a Teammate

The command `module add` creates a new `Module` object, which contains the necessary fields that are associated with an NUS module.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/ModuleAddActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The implementation of the `module add` command is largely similar to the `Person` variation. 

#### Deleting a Module for a Teammate

The command `module delete` removes an existing `Module` from a `Person`.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/ModuleDeleteActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The implementation of the `module delete` command is largely similar to the `Person` variation. 

### Meeting

A Meeting is composed of several attributes:
- `date`: The date of the meeting, stored as a `LocalDate` object.
- `startTime`: The start time of the meeting, stored as a  `LocalTime` object.
- `endTime`: The end time of the meeting, stored as a  `LocalTime` object.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
The startTime and endTime validation checks for `Meeting` is similar to `Module`. It is also not possible to add a meeting with invalid times (i.e. start time later than end time), or to add a meeting when there is already an existing meeting within that time period.
</div>

#### Adding a Meeting

The command `meeting add` creates a new `Meeting` object, which contains the necessary fields that are associated with an NUS module.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/MeetingAddActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The implementation of the `meeting add` command is largely similar to the `Person` variation. 

#### Deleting a Meeting

The command `meeting delete` deletes an existing `Meeting`.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/MeetingDeleteActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The implementation of the `meeting delete` command is largely similar to the `Person` variation.

### General Commands

#### Show Date

The command `showdate` update the timetable to show the specified date's week.

<img src="images/ShowDateCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

#### Help

The command `help` shows a message explaining how to access the user guide.

<img src="images/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

#### Clear

The command `clear` clears all teammates, modules and meetings from TeamSync.

<img src="images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="600"/>

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

_Coming soon ..._

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level

Our project is significantly more advanced than AB3, featuring new commands and enhanced functionalities. Student objects now include a modules attribute for schedule coordination. The UI is also more complex, incorporating a timetable view that displays shared schedules and scheduled meetings for the week.

### Challenges Faced

UI update: Providing a fresh look for the application with colours more appealing than AB3 as well as the new timetable view required multiple revisions.\
Schedule logic: Introduction of logic for modules and meetings required careful planning on implementation as well as how to display them in the application

### Effort Required

Our project involved substantial effort in several key areas:

Refactoring: Codebase was refactored to MVVM architecture to better facilitate development\
Commands: Multiple new commands were added and existing commands modified to better suit our application\
UI: Effort was required for the new timetable view and how schedules were displayed as well as the ability to modify the current view

### Achievements

# We have enhanced the AB3 application with new features and design to better suit project management of NUS students
