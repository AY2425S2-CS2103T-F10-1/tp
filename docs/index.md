TeamSync is a contact management app designed to streamline group project management **for NUS students**. TeamSync combines the intuitive visuals of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the speed and precision of a Command Line Interface (CLI), enabling students to effortlessly manage teammates' contact details, schedule meetings, and stay organized.

* If you are interested in using TeamSync, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TeamSync, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
