## <a href="#table-of-contents" class="head">About TeamSync</a>

TeamSync is a contact management app designed to streamline group project management **for NUS students**.

Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, TeamSync makes it easy to add teammates' contact details, schedule meetings, and stay organized. It combines the intuitive visuals of a Graphical User Interface ([GUI](#graphical-user-interface)) with the speed and precision of a Command Line Interface ([CLI](#command-line-interface)). Built-in validation checks help prevent errors, ensuring a seamless experience.

Whether you are new to [CLI](#command-line-interface) applications or are an experienced user, TeamSync enables you to work faster than any [GUI](#graphical-user-interface)-only app — so you can focus on what truly matters.

**It is strongly recommended to make a backup of `teamsync.json` before editing it.**

If your edits to `teamsync.json` corrupts it and TeamSync is unable to load the data, **TeamSync will discard all data** and start with an empty data file at the next run.

Furthermore, **certain edits can cause TeamSync to behave in unexpected ways**.

Therefore, **edit the file only if you are confident** that you can update it correctly.

## <a href="#table-of-contents" class="head">Troubleshooting</a>

**1**\. **The <a href="#graphical-user-interface" style="color : black;">GUI</a> appears off-screen** <br>
This may occur when using multiple screens. To resolve this issue, simply delete the `preferences.json` file located in TeamSync's [home folder](#home-folder) before restarting the app.

**2**\. **Unable to run the JAR file** <br>
Ensure you have followed the steps outlined in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section. In particular, double-clicking on the JAR file **might not** launch the app.

## <a href="#table-of-contents" class="head">FAQ</a>

**Q**: **How do I transfer my data to another computer?**<br>
**A**: Copy the contents of TeamSync's [home folder](#home-folder) to the other computer. You are now able to continue using TeamSync with all your existing data.

**Q**: **What are the system requirements for TeamSync?**<br>
**A**: TeamSync is optimised for Windows, MacOS, and Linux only. Additionally, Java `17` or above must be installed. While TeamSync might run on unsupported systems, we do not provide any assistance for these environments.

**Q**: **Why does TeamSync store past meetings?**<br>
**A**: We believe that there is value in storing your past meetings for archival purposes. These are highlighted in red in the <a href="#meeting-view" style="color : brown; font-weight: bold;">meeting view</a> and can be deleted at your discretion.

**Q**: **Will TeamSync be updated to support editing modules via the [`person edit`](#editing-a-teammate--person-edit) command?**<br>
**A**: No. This is a deliberate design decision. As modules consist of three fields — a date, start and end time — editing them through [`person edit`](#editing-a-teammate--person-edit) increases the likelihood of human error.

**Q**: **Will TeamSync be updated to prompt for confirmation before clearing all data?**<br>
**A**: No. The [`clear`](#clearing-all-data--clear) command is the only way to clear all data. Adding a confirmation prompt is unlikely to reduce accidental usage.
